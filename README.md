# JavaScript-Projects

This Repository will be used to store all the challenges and assignments that
I will get throughout my Javascript course.

Here are some small projects I made during the course

Projects:
- Pizza Menu
- tic tac toe game
- calculator

Pizza Menu:
    In this project I created a pizza menu where you can pick a pizza
    of your choosing and add toppings of your choosing then it would 
    calculate the price of your pizza

Tic tac toe game:
    In this project I created a simple tic tac toe game that you 
    play against your computer. 

Calculator: 
    In this project I created a non-scientific calculator. It can add,
    subtract, multiply and divide.
